This fractal can be described as a "recursive cubic fractal" or "hierarchical cube fractal." It is generated by repeatedly subdividing a cube into eight smaller cubes, using recursive algorithms to achieve self-similarity. 
Each iteration reduces the size of the cubes and increases the complexity of the structure, resembling patterns such as the Menger sponge.

**Instructions for Running the Script**

Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Run the following command to install them:

`pip install numpy pyvista imageio`


Run the Script: Save the script to a file, e.g., skyblock.py, and execute it using Python:

`python skyblock.py`


Choose an Option from the Menu: When the script runs, you will see the following options:


**1 - Generate a model: Creates a fractal model.**

You will be prompted to specify the recursion depth (recommended 3-7).
You can save the model with a custom name or choose the default press Y.
The generated model will be visualized automatically.


**2 - Load and visualize a model: Loads a fractal model from a file and visualizes it.**
Enter the name of the file (without the .pkl extension) to load.


**0 - Exit**


Example Workflow:

Generate a fractal model by selecting 1 and saving it as example_model.

Load the saved model by selecting 2 and entering example_model.

Create a GIF animation from the saved model by selecting 3.


Output Files:

Models are saved as .pkl files (e.g., example_model.pkl).


You can change the color options.

I recommend level 7 for a detailed picture. Increasing the level increases the complexity of calculations by 8 times. 

It turns out that between levels 5 and 7 the difference is 64 times.
